The International Wages for Housework Campaign was a feminist global social movement, which grew out of the International Feminist Collective in Italy in 1972 and organized resistance and public debate on the social formations produced by gendered labor and reproductive labor, for example domestic work like housework, childcare, gender discrimination, and the socially reinforced performance of gender roles, gendered desire, and leisure inequality.
